##Solr vs. ElasticSearch - Case by Case

Comparisons between Solr and ElasticSearch are common and popular. However, they focus on the feature checklists and are very shallow.

This repository will explore at the real search use-cases (searching multiple fields, dynamic fields, data import, nested documents, etc) and see how the solutions are represented in Solr's and ElasticSearch's paradigms. Some usability aspects will also be addressed (such as minimal configuration, dynamic field types, JSON handling).

It will include the full configuration and data files to make reproducing the experiments easy.

## The book
The narrative part of the analysis will be published as a [free online book](https://leanpub.com/solr-vs-elasticsearch).

## The talk
The summary of findings will be presented as a talk in November 2014 at the upcoming [Lucene/Solr Revolution Conference](http://www.lucenerevolution.org/).

Apart from feature discussion, the talk will touch on Solr being subjected to an innovator's dilemma and possible ways to benefit, rather than suffer from it.
