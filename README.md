solr-vs-elasticsearch
=====================

Configuration and data files to compare Solr and Elastic Search for identical use cases

Backing material for the upcoming Lucene Revolution talk in November 2014:

###Solr vs. ElasticSearch - Case by Case

Comparisons between Solr and ElasticSearch are common and popular. However, they focus on the feature checklists and are very shallow.

This talk will look at the real search use-cases (searching multiple fields, dynamic fields, data import, nested documents, etc) and see how the solutions are represented in Solr's and ElasticSearch's paradigms. Some usability aspects will also be discussed (such as minimal configuration, dynamic field types, JSON handling).

Finally, the talk will touch on Solr being subjected to an innovator's dilemma and possible ways to benefit, rather than suffer from it.
