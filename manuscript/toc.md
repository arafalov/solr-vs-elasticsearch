# Introduction

Comparisons between Solr and ElasticSearch are common and popular. However, they focus on the feature checklists and are very shallow.

This book will look at the real search use-cases (searching multiple fields, dynamic fields, data import, nested documents, etc) and see how the solutions are represented in Solr's and ElasticSearch's paradigms. Some usability aspects will also be discussed (such as minimal configuration, dynamic field types, JSON handling).

# Political level

Should this be Solr vs. ElasticSearch. Or LucidImagination vs. ElasticSearch? Or even Cloudera vs. ElasticSearch?

# Philosophy level

## Kitchen Sink vs. Components
Solr is a Kitchen Sink. Elastic Search is small core + plugins. But what does ES small initial size mean for common operations?

## Clients

# Technical level

# Simple example
1. Download
2. Unpack
3. Start
4. Run the first example (does ES ship with one?)
5. Check it on command line
6. Check it in web browser (flash development-only)

# Cases

## The case of Administration Console 
diff between Open Source and commercial

## The case of file-sizes 
Javadoc, etc

## The case of mangled names

## The case of PDF processing

## The case of client ecosystem

## The case of index size 
store all by default, ES document field vs. index field vs ???

## The case of dynamic fields 
ES equivalent? Templates?

## The case of schemaless mode 
How to use, how to modify the sequence (e.g. date formats)

## The case of Castle in the Cloud

# Complex example
